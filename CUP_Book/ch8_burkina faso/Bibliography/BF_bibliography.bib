abstract = {Effective policy-making requires that voters avoid electing malfeasant politicians. We ra- tionalize the mixed evidence of incumbent sanctioning in developing contexts in a simple Bayesian model emphasizing voters' prior beliefs and updating. Specifically, electoral pun- ishment of incumbents revealed to be malfeasant is rare where voters already believed them to be malfeasant, while the effect of information on turnout is non-linear in the magnitude of revealed malfeasance. The theory is supported by a field experiment informing Mexican voters about malfeasant mayoral spending before municipal elections. Given voters' lowexpectations and uncertainty, as well as politician responses, relatively severe malfeasance revelations in- creased incumbent vote share on average. Consistent with voter learning, rewards were lower among voters with lower malfeasance priors and stronger prior beliefs, and when audits re- vealed greater malfeasance, and caused voters to unfavorably update their posterior beliefs. Further supporting our theory, both low and high malfeasance revelations increased turnout, while relatively unsurprising information reduced turnout.},

abstract = {African elections often reveal low levels of political account- ability. We assess different forms of voter education during an election in Mozambique. Three interventions providing information to voters and calling for their participation were randomized: an information campaign using SMS, an SMS hotline for electoral misconduct, and the distribution of a free newspaper. To measure impact, we look at official electoral results, reports by electoral observers, and behavioral and survey data. We find positive effects of all treatments on voter turnout. However, only the distribution of the free newspaper led to more accountability-based participation},

abstract = {During the past decade, blind analysis has become a widely used tool in nuclear and particle physics measurements. A blind analysis avoids the possibility of experimenters biasing their result toward their own preconceptions by preventing them from knowing the answer until the analysis is complete. There is at least circumstantial evidence that such a bias has affected past measurements, and as experiments have become costlier and more difficult and hence harder to reproduce, the possibility of bias has become a more important issue than in the past.We describe here the motivations for performing a blind analysis, and give several modern examples of successful blind analysis strategies.},

abstract = {Democratic theory often assumes that offering more information to voters will enhance electoral accountability. However, it is unclear whether corruption information translates into higher political participation and increased support for challengers. For example, information on corruption could lower the utility one gets from participating in elections at all. We provide experimental evidence that such information not only decreases incumbent party support in local elec- tions in Mexico, but also decreases voter turnout and votes for the challenger party, as well as erodes partisan attachments. Our results suggest that while information clearly is necessary to improve accountability, corruption informa- tion is not necessarily sufficient, since voters may respond to it by withdrawing from the political process. 1Corresponding},

We argue that innovations in governance of social services may yield the highest return since social service delivery in developing countries is often plagued by inefficiencies and corruption. We illustrate this by using data from an unusual policy experiment. A newspaper campaign in Uganda aimed at reducing capture of public funds by providing schools (parents) with informa- tion to monitor local officials' handling of a large education grant program. The campaignwas highly successful and the reduction in capture had a positive effect on enrollment and student learning.},

A field experiment across 95 localities in Mali in which randomly assigned localities receive a civics course identifies the effect of raising voter expectations of government on their willingness to hold leaders accountable. The course provides information about local government capacity and responsibility as well as how local politicians perform relative to others, effectively raising voter expectations of what local governments can and should do. Survey experiments among individuals in treated and control communities (N=5,560) suggest that people in treated villages are indeed more likely to sanction poor performers and vote based on performance more often.},

We employ a diagnostic framework to analyze local government discretion and account- ability in Burkina Faso.We find that local governments have a very low degree of discretionary power accompanied with weak accountability towards citizens at all levels. In the political and administrative spheres, the center plays a dominant role in local government affairs leaving little space for discretion. In the fiscal sphere, taxing powers are restricted, while transfers are insufficient and unpredictable, making local financial management extremely difficult.},
